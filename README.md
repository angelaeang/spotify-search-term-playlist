# spotify-search-term-playlist

## Background
- This program makes a Spotify playlist based on a search term.
It will search for 20 playlists that have that search term, and add a random song from each playlist.
- This only works if you have the necessary codes and information. I have information about
my application's client id and secret code, username, tokens, etc. I specified that in a file called
private.py that I did not include.
- Receiving this information takes some time to setup through Spotify's developer tools. The tutorial I will mention is 
helpful for that.

### Thanks [EuanMorgan](https://youtu.be/-FsFT6OwE1A) on YouTube!
- EuanMorgan's SpotifyDiscoverWeeklyRescuer helped me get started.

## Files
- I did not include the private.py file because that 
includes private information such as my username and different
personal codes.
